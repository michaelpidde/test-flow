This is a basic web GUI test automation framework utilizing Java and Selenium.


USAGE
----------------------------------------------------------------
* You must copy the browser executables from /drivers to the same directory where your jar lives.

* Run Maven compile with assembly:single to grab all dependencies and move some static files to the right place.

* Run with:
java -jar ./target/test-flow.jar

* Or run CLI directly with:
java -cp ./target/test-flow.jar com.michaelpidde.testflow.Cli -h


DEPENDENCIES
----------------------------------------------------------------
Java and Javac must be version 1.7 or above.

These are all handled by Maven if you choose to use it (why would you not?):

* Selenium client and webdriver bindings
* args4j
* Jetty
* Freemarker templating engine
* JavaMail
(Not currently used, but will be in the future:)
* JDBC driver
